        1. JavaScript/CSS resource transitive dependency resolution
           using JSDoc @requires tags.

        2. On-the-fly compressed deploy/debug mode using Google
           Closure Compiler.
        
        3. JSLint of JavaScript using Douglas Crockford's excellent
           tool via jslint4java.

        4. Concept of "bundles" that allows for javascript packaging
           inside .jar-files.
